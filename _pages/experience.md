Graduate Research Assistant
======
*  Graduate Research Assistant (May 2024 - Present) in the Department of Computer Science working on developing deep learning embedding models for tabular data understanding to aid table search and data 
fusion.
   * BigLab: Developed transformer-based model aligned with BERT configurations to create structurally aware composite embeddings for tables with complex structured data, outperforming state-of-the-art models by up to 28%. Fine-tuned Large Language Models like GPT2, Llama2, and several transformer-based deep learning models, as well as classic Word2vec NLP embedding model on large-scale structured datasets.
   * Bioinformatics Lab (Summer 2021): Worked on Complex Structural Variant (SV) detection using long read DNA sequencing data. Utilized the union-find 
algorithm for clustering potential SVs from aligned long reads. 

Graduate Teaching Assistant
======
* Graduate Teaching Assistant in the Department of Computer Science (Aug. 2021 - May. 2024) for courses including Unix Tools (COP4342), Operating Systems (COP4610), Data Structures, and Algorithms 
(COP4530), Introduction to Data Science (CAP5768), and Advanced Data Science (CAP5769). 
  * Lead recitation TA for Advanced Data Science (CAP5769), Spring 2024

Software Engineer
======
* Tekvortex Pvt. Ltd. Pulchowk, Lalitpur, Nepal (June 2020 - Dec.2020)
  * Enhanced existing software that assists clients in determining whether to migrate from on-premises servers to AWS Cloud by providing cluster suggestions and cost estimates. Improved cost accuracy by 5% by adding disk usage calculations. Fixed multiple production issues/bugs, reducing customer support tickets by 30% through collaborating with the Support Team.

Software Engineer
======
* E&T Nepal Pvt. Ltd, Lokanthali, Bhaktapur, Nepal (Jan. 2018 - Feb. 2020)
